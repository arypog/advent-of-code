# Welcome to my advent of code repository
My main goal for 2024 was to experiment with new languages. And I didn't do that.
Why? Because I lacked the skill to solve some problems, and if I couldn't solve 
them in Python, there was no way I could do it in Haskellâ€”in a day, that is.
So for 2025 onward, the plan is simple: "Git gud."
